- Observation strategy
  - Don’t combine `@Observable` and `@Published` in the same class
  - For managers referenced via KeyPaths, prefer `ObservableObject` with plain stored properties
- Event scoping
  - Use domain‑scoped enums: `AchievementGameEvent`, `CharacterReactionEvent`, `AccessibilityGameEvent`
