## 📐 Technical Architecture Handoff

### **Established Architecture Patterns**

#### **MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)**
```swift
// Proven pattern successfully implemented:
Models/Core/        → Pure data structures and business logic
Views/Game/         → SwiftUI UI components  
ViewModels/         → Presentation logic and state management
Controllers/        → Navigation and flow coordination
Managers/           → Cross-cutting concerns (Audio, Haptic, etc.)
```

#### **ObservableObject Integration**
```swift
// GameState.swift - Foundation for Phase 3 real-time features:
class GameState: ObservableObject {
    @Published var phase: GamePhase
    @Published var players: [Player] 
    @Published var tableCards: [Card]
    // Ready for CloudKit integration in Phase 3
}
```

#### **Metal Rendering Foundation**
```swift
// Established files ready for Phase 3 completion:
- Renderer.swift: Core Metal rendering setup
- GameViewController.swift: UIKit-Metal integration
- Shaders.metal.disabled: Ready for re-enablement
```

### **Manager System Architecture**
```
Established manager classes ready for Phase 3 completion:
✅ AnimationManager.swift    → Ready for Metal integration
✅ AudioManager.swift        → Ready for Romanian cultural music
